## Overview
The steps of this project are the following:
* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients with a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and nuemerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

#### Tech Stack
* Python
* NumPy
* OpenCV

### Camera calibration using chessboard images
A set of chessboard images photographed at different angles were used for this purpose.
